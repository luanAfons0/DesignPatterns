# 🧠 OOP Principles Reference Project

This project serves as a simple and educational reference for the **core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using clear and practical examples.

## 📌 What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods). It aims to organize software design around data and behaviors.

## 🚀 OOP Principles Covered

### 1. **Encapsulation**

> Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within one unit (class), and restricting direct access to some of the object’s components.

**Example in this project:**

- A `Dog` class with private fields and public getters/setters.

### 2. **Abstraction**

> Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.

**Example in this project:**

- An abstract class `Animal` with a method `getSound()` implemented by subclasses like `Dog` and `Cat`.

### 3. **Inheritance**

> Inheritance allows one class (child) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (parent), promoting code reuse.

**Example in this project:**

- A base class `Animal`, extended by `Dog` and `Cat` classes.

### 4. **Polymorphism**

> Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling a single interface to control access to different types of objects.

**Example in this project:**

- A method `makeSound()` overridden in multiple subclasses of `Animal`.
